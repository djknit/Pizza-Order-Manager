# Pizza-Order-Manager
The goal of this project is to design an app that can create and manage orders for a certain local pizza shop. The app should be able to calculate the lowest possible price for a given order by applying specials and comparing the different ways the same exact food could be ordered.

This project is developed and maintained by David Knittel.
